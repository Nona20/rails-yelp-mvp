! Create a PhoneNumber for the restaurants.
  ? Copy the features of Reviews
    ? Let's draw a route
    $ Route created
  (restaurant has_many :reviews ok)
    ? In the Model
      - Yes, copying previous model
    ? Create a view
      - Ok, copied from Chef, added in Show
    ? Create a controller
      ? do I need a controller?
      - Not really, but maybe an action
  - Looks like things are connected, time to test
  - Displays "phone number" in restaurants
  ! When I click on 'Show' I get an undefined method for phone number
    ? show does not support phone number
    - I think it's ok
    ? phone number shouldn't be there
    - It makes sense to display it here
    ? There's actually no method for phone_number
      ? maybe that means that there's no action in the controller for this.
      - There's an action
      ? We need to check the model
      $ Got help from Nick and I should have created a migration
    $ Error Solved
  $ Shouldn't have copied the features of Reviews
- Raking and moving on...
- Keep working on adding the attributes for restaurant
! Restaurant has a category
  ? use a migration
  $ Worked
! chinese, italian, french, japanese are valid categories
  ? check in the slides 'validation'
    ? Check deeper activeRecord validation
    - test with 'validates :category, inclusion: { in: %w(belgian french chinese japanese italian)}'
  ! Doesn't work.
  ? The syntax is wrong
    ? Check the syntax again
      ? Trying with more simple syntax
      X Still not working
      ? Cairan helped
      X Still not
    - Maybe not a syntax problem
    ? Ticket|Joao. I should have db:migrate & db:seed
    X Still the same problem, still the same error message
    ...
$ Problem solved
! Main problem with ratings
  ! the database keeps giving 'stars' as an attribute
$ Problem solved with ratings
! Review has a rating (stored as integer)
  ? do a migrate remove, migrate add
$ Probelm solved with help from Nick. You can edit the migrate files

! Content cannot be blank
? Validation
$ ALL GREEN For now

!  RestaurantsController GET index assigns all restaurants as @restaurants
? Check the rails routes and see what's wrong
X Not from there
$ Needed a gem to install. The rake file was mentionning it
!  RestaurantsController POST create with valid params creates a new Restaurant Failure/Error: expected #count to have changed by 1, but was changed by 0
